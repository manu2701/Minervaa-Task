# Student Performance Predictor

This project is a **machine learning-based application** that predicts student performance based on various factors like exam scores, attendance, study hours, activity hours, and stress levels. The project leverages Python libraries like `scikit-learn`, `pandas`, and `joblib` for building and deploying the model.

## Features
- **Data Handling**: Collects and preprocesses input data for accurate predictions.
- **Machine Learning**: Uses a linear regression model to predict student performance.
- **Deployment**: The model is deployed using **FastAPI** and served via **Uvicorn**.
- **REST API**: Accepts JSON input to predict performance and returns the results in real-time.
- **Normalization**: Handles data scaling for better machine learning performance.
- **User Inputs**: Supports inputs such as:
  - Exam Scores (Exam_1 to Exam_6)
  - Attendance Percentage
  - Study Hours per Day
  - Activity Hours per Day
  - Stress Levels (Scale of 1â€“5)

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: JSON input for API testing (can be extended to a web UI).
- **Backend**:
  - `FastAPI` for building the API.
  - `Uvicorn` for serving the API.
- **Machine Learning**:
  - `scikit-learn` for training and saving the model.
  - `joblib` for model serialization and loading.
- **Environment**:
  - Python 3.11
  - Virtual Environment (`venv`) for dependencies.

## Prerequisites
Ensure the following are installed:
- Python 3.11
- pip (Python Package Installer)

## Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/student-performance-predictor.git
   cd student-performance-predictor
   ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv myenv
   source myenv/bin/activate  # On Windows: myenv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   pip show scikit-learn
   ```

## Usage
### Training the Model
1. Add or preprocess training data.
2. Train the model and save it as `linear_model.pkl`:
   ```python
   # Example: train_model.py
   from sklearn.linear_model import LinearRegression
   import joblib
   import pandas as pd

   # Load your dataset
   data = pd.read_csv('data.csv')  # Add your data file here
   X = data[['Exam_1', 'Exam_2', 'Exam_3', 'Exam_4', 'Exam_5', 'Exam_6', 'Attendance', 'Study_Hours', 'Activity_Hours', 'Stress_Level']]
   y = data['Performance']

   # Train the model
   model = LinearRegression()
   model.fit(X, y)

   # Save the model
   joblib.dump(model, 'linear_model.pkl')
   print("Model trained and saved!")
   ```

## Running the API
1. Start the API server:
   bash:
   uvicorn api:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
   

2. Test the API with the following JSON input:
   json
   {
       "Exam_1": 75.0,
       "Exam_2": 80.0,
       "Exam_3": 70.0,
       "Exam_4": 85.0,
       "Exam_5": 90.0,
       "Exam_6": 78.0,
       "Attendance": 92.0,
       "Study_Hours": 10.0,
       "Activity_Hours": 4.0,
       "Stress_Level": 3.0
   }

## Explorataion
During the exploration phase, multiple machine learning models were tested to evaluate their performance in predicting student outcomes. Below is an explanation of the approaches tried and their respective results:

## 1. Linear Regression
Linear Regression provided the best results, achieving 93.6% accuracy. This model worked well because the relationships between the features and the target variable were largely linear, and the dataset was free from significant noise or complex non-linear dependencies.

Why it Worked Best:

Captured the strong linear correlations between features like Attendance, Study_Hours, and exam scores.
Simplicity and interpretability made it easy to identify the most impactful features.
## 2. Random Forest Regressor
Random Forest was tested to explore non-linear relationships and feature interactions. However, the model underperformed compared to Linear Regression.

The model faced challenges with overfitting, likely due to the relatively small size of the dataset.
While it highlighted feature importance effectively, the accuracy dropped due to unnecessary complexity.
Performance: Accuracy was significantly lower than Linear Regression.

## 3. XGBoost Regressor
XGBoost, known for its ability to handle complex data patterns, was also tested. Despite its advanced capabilities, it did not outperform Linear Regression.

The model's performance was hindered by the lack of non-linear interactions or high-dimensional complexity in the dataset.
Tuning hyperparameters did not yield significant improvement, suggesting the dataset's structure was better suited for simpler models.
Performance: Accuracy was lower than Linear Regression, with no clear advantage in handling the dataset.
##  Future Enhancements
- Add a web-based user interface using ReactJS or HTML/CSS.
- Integrate more machine learning models for better accuracy.
- Expand the dataset with real-world examples.
- Implement CI/CD pipelines for automated deployment.
- ## Challenges Solved
- Resolved `ModuleNotFoundError` for `sklearn` by ensuring proper environment setup.
- Normalized input data for optimal model training and performance.
- Successfully deployed a machine learning model using FastAPI.

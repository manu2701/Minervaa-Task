# Minervaa-Task
A student performance predictor analysing various facts such as Stress Level,Study hours,Activity hours and etc.

Dataset Overview:-

The dataset titled Realistic Student Performance contains simulated data for analyzing the academic performance of students. It includes 1,000 records, each representing a student, and is designed to assess the relationship between various factors (e.g., exam scores, attendance, and study habits) and predicted future marks.

Dataset Structure:- 
The dataset comprises the following 11 columns:
Exam_1 to Exam_6: Scores of six individual exams (Range: 30-100).
Attendance (%): Attendance percentage of the student (Range: 50.01%-99.98%).
Study Hours: Average daily study hours (Range: 1-9.99 hours).
Activity Hours: Average daily hours spent on extracurricular or leisure activities (Range: 0.01-5 hours).
Stress Level: A numeric value indicating the student's stress level, rated on a scale from 1 to 9.99.
Future Marks: Predicted or aggregated future performance score (Range: 30-100).

Key Highlights:-
No Missing Data: All fields are fully populated with valid values, ensuring data completeness.
Numeric Data: All columns are numeric, simplifying statistical analysis and machine learning applications.
Balanced Ranges: Values are distributed uniformly across plausible ranges, making the dataset suitable for regression, classification, or exploratory data analysis.

Intended Use:-
This dataset is crafted for educational and analytical purposes, including:
Predictive Modeling: Train machine learning models to predict future performance based on various features.
Correlation Analysis: Explore relationships between exam scores, study habits, and other factors.
Stress Management Insights: Examine how stress and activity levels impact academic outcomes.
